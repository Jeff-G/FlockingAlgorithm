# MATLAB Flocking Algorithm with Natural Bird Movement
This repository includes the MATLAB code used to generate a three dimensional model of flocking birds.  Unlike other models, this takes momentum and field-of-view into account when computing accelerations at each time step.

A paper describing the algorithm is available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KLgP5C-U1ItxeOno1qzMcgMCTdDs1hpB/view?usp=sharing), alongside [example outputs generated by the model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V-x9QQoyoA4k15CxMcTa6M_wEgIWfdrO?usp=sharing).

To be able to utilize all features of this software, you must have MATLAB R2020b or newer installed on your system.  To the author's knowledge, no additional MATLAB toolboxes are required.
